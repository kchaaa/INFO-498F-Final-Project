Our final project focuses on the current water crisis that is devastating the city of Flint, Michigan. We obtained data of the city's water lead and copper level based on the locations around the city and created visualizations to answer questions about the dataset. The water crisis is a very controversial and an on-going topic in the Presidential debates. We hope to raise awareness about this subject to help others gain a better understanding of the situation through our visualizations.

All of the samples in our datasets were collected with the help of Flint citizens. We used datasets from the [flintwaterstudy.org](http://flintwaterstudy.org/2015/12/complete-dataset-lead-results-in-tap-water-for-271-flint-samples/) and [michigan.gov] (http://www.michigan.gov/flintwater).
